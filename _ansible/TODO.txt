- For a total re-installation:
	- Create a new project
	- Send you the .rc to source
	- Release IPs 172.24.4.236, 172.24.4.199, 172.24.4.206, 172.24.4.129 from the other project
	- Add max and geo users, as well as eval user to read-only
	- Import the 3 all-keys
	- Ensure the ubuntu.mini flavor exists as well as the database volume
	- Run ./ansible and pray God
	- Place eval.key inside the loadbalancer

- On all: 
	- Check correctness of routes and reachability of the private subnets

- In database machine:
	- check IP addresses in setup.sql 
	- install the database from setup.sql: sudo mysql -u"root" -p"FCCpr0ject=" < setup.sql
	- allow the database_user from remote addresses 10.10.30.0/24 to access the database: in  
	/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf: bind-address 0.0.0.0 (or the IPs of the servers) 
	If 0.0.0.0 we can also change the security groups to only allow connections from the subnet
		For MySql version 8.0.13 and above, you can specify a list of comma-separated IP addresses: bind-address = 10.0.0.1,10.0.1.1,10.0.2.1. 
		Remember to restart your MySQL instance after changing the config file.

- On servers:
	- Change php configuration by swapping "php" and "html" inside of /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
	- Mount the /mnt/sharedMusic folder as a NFS folder specifying the private IP of the database: 
		sudo mount 10.10.30.97:/mnt/sharedMusic /mnt/sharedMusic
	- Manually install Ampache from browser and check the configurations in setup.sql
	- in /etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini -> change upload_max_filesize to 30MB, post_max_size to 40MB
