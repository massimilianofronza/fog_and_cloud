- On all: 
	- Check correctness of routes and reachability of the private subnets

- In database machine:
	- check IP addresses in setup.sql 
	- install the database from setup.sql: sudo mysql -u"root" -p"FCCpr0ject=" < setup.sql
	- allow the database_user from remote addresses 10.10.30.0/24 to access the database: in  
	/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf: bind-address 0.0.0.0 (or the IPs of the servers) 
	If 0.0.0.0 we can also change the security groups to only allow connections from the subnet
		For MySql version 8.0.13 and above, you can specify a list of comma-separated IP addresses: bind-address = 10.0.0.1,10.0.1.1,10.0.2.1. 
		Remember to restart your MySQL instance after changing the config file.

- On servers: 
	- Mount the /data/sharedMusic folder as a NFS folder specifying the private IP of the database
	- Manually install Ampache from browser and check the configurations
	- also change php configurations 
	- in /etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini -> change upload_max_filesize to 20MB, post_max_size to 30MB
