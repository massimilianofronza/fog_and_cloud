K8S volumes ex 22
with kubectl describe pod ws-persistent-etc
	- see node -> georgina.bud-worker2 

We can check the status of the persistent storage on the node via docker exec, 
because the worker node is in a container: 
docker exec -it georgiana.bud-worker2 ls /var/local-path-provisioner/.../


LOAD IMAGE INTO K8s
kind load docker-image ampache-admin --name georgiana.bud !!! NOT WORKING

In order to see the images that are present in the cluster: 
docker exec -it georgiana.bud-worker crictl images
docker exec -it georgiana.bud-worker crictl rmi ampache-admin
